This project is created like a project for the course "Robot Motion Planning" held by Jean-Paul LAUMOND at Ecole Normale Superieure ULM, Paris, by Denys KANUNIKOV in 2014. 
It's an implementation of the Vis-PRM algorithme described in "T. Siméon, J.P. Laumond, C. Nissoux, Visibility based probabilistic roadmaps for motion planning. Advanced Robotics Journal, Vol. 14, N°6, D´ecembre 2000". This implementation use OMPL library (http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/) version 0.14. To use this implementation you should download and run OMPL library and add PRM-vis.h to '/ompl/src/ompl/geometric/planners/prm' and PRM-vis.cpp to '/ompl/src/ompl/geometric/planners/prm/src'.
