                constructRoadmap(). This function can be called
                multiple times on the same problem, without calling
                clear() in between. This allows the planner to
                continue work for more time on an unsolved problem,
                for example. Start and goal states from the currently
                specified ProblemDefinition are cached. This means
                that between calls to solve(), input states are only
                added, not removed. When using PRM as a multi-query
                planner, the input states should be however cleared,
                without clearing the roadmap itself. This can be done
